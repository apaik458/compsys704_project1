# Automated Bottling System (ABS)
Group project using SystemJ and Java for COMPSYS 704 Advanced Embedded Systems in 2025.
A group project where we developed an Automated Bottling System, ABS, (manufacturing component). This bottles the liquids produced by mixing two
 liquids based on customised recipes before shipping them to the customers.

# Attention
Current code doesn't functioning, Tianyi and Jack rewrite the whole ABS in lab3 fold, logic seems right but viz meets problems , the signal E cannot be received somehow.
